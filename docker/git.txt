Core Terminology
Repository: All your code/history.

Working Directory: Files you’re editing.

Staging Area: Where you prepare changes before committing.

Commit: Snapshot with unique hash.

HEAD: The current commit reference.

Frequently Asked Interview Questions
1. Difference between git pull and git fetch:
pull: Fetches + merges remote changes into local branch.

fetch: Only gets changes; doesn’t merge automatically.

2. Branching and Merging:
Branching: Separate work (feature/hotfix branches).

Merging: Combines changes.

Fast-forward: Simple move forward.

Three-way: Resolves diverged histories.

3. Merge Conflict:
Happens when the same lines/files are changed in different branches.

Resolution: Manual edit + git add to mark as resolved.

4. Rebase vs Merge:
Rebase: Rewrites history by replaying commits; creates a linear history.

Merge: Combines two branches, can create a merge commit.

5. Reset vs Revert:
Reset: Changes branch pointer (can delete history!).

Revert: Adds a new commit that undoes a previous one (safer for shared branches).

6. Stash:
Temporarily save (stash) changes you aren’t ready to commit.

git stash to save, git stash apply to restore.

7. Tags:
Lightweight: Just a pointer.

Annotated: Contains metadata (message, tagger, date).

Useful for versioning/releases.

8. Hooks:
Scripts that automate actions before/after events (pre-commit, post-receive).

Used in CI/CD to enforce code quality, automate tests, deployments.

9. Submodules:
Allows including other repositories as directories inside a main repo.

Useful for dependencies, but can add complexity.

10. Git Workflows:
Gitflow: Feature/release/hotfix branches, strict discipline.

Trunk-based: Everyone commits to main, encourages fast integration.

Forking: Used in open-source/collaborative projects.

11. CI/CD with Git:
Git events (push, PR, tags) trigger pipelines (build, test, deploy).

12. Cherry-pick:
Apply a specific commit from one branch to another.
13. Squash Commits:
Combine multiple commits into one for cleaner history.  
14. Git Aliases:
Shortcuts for common commands (e.g., git co for checkout).


1. Git kya hai, aur DevOps me kyun use hota hai?
Git: Distributed version control system for tracking changes in code.
DevOps me use: Collaboration, code quality, and CI/CD automation ke liye.

2. Git repository, working directory, staging area, commit—difference explain karo.
Git repository: Central storage for all code and history.
Working directory: Local files you’re editing.
Staging area: Prepares changes before committing.
Commit: Snapshot of changes with a unique hash.

3. git fetch vs git pull?
git fetch: Remote changes ko download karta hai, local branch me merge nahi karta.
git pull: Remote changes ko download aur local branch me merge karta hai.

4. Branching and merging kya hai? Use-cases?
Branching: Separate work on features or fixes (e.g., feature branches).
Merging: Combines changes from different branches (e.g., merging feature branch into main).

5. Fast-forward merge vs three-way merge kya hai?
Fast-forward merge: Simple move forward when no diverging commits.
Three-way merge: Resolves diverged histories using a common ancestor.   

6. Merge conflict hota hai toh kaise resolve karte ho?
Merge conflict: Same lines/files changed in different branches.
Resolution: Manual edit to resolve conflicts, then git add to mark as resolved.

7. Git rebase vs git merge me farq?
Rebase: Rewrites history by replaying commits; creates a linear history.
Merge: Combines two branches, can create a merge commit.

8. git reset, git revert, aur git checkout me difference?
git reset: Changes branch pointer, can delete history (use with caution).
git revert: Adds a new commit that undoes a previous one (safer for shared branches).
git checkout: Switches branches or restores files to a specific state.

9. Git stash kya hai aur kab use karte ho?
Git stash: Temporarily saves changes you aren’t ready to commit.

13. Gitflow vs trunk-based development me difference?
Gitflow: Structured branching model with feature, release, and hotfix branches.
Trunk-based: Everyone commits to the main branch, encourages fast integration.

14. Git history ko clean ya squash kaise karte ho?
Squash commits: Combine multiple commits into one for cleaner history using `git rebase -i`.

17. Merge conflict resolve karne ka process step by step batao.
1. Identify conflicting files using `git status`.
2. Open conflicting files and manually resolve conflicts.
3. Use `git add <file>` to mark conflicts as resolved.
4. Commit the changes with `git commit`.
5. Push the resolved changes to the remote repository.

18. Accidentally production branch pe galat commit push ho gaya—undo kaise karoge?
1. Identify the commit using `git log`.
2. Use `git revert <commit_hash>` to create a new commit that undoes the changes.
3. Push the revert commit to the remote repository.

22. Ek shared repo me push access nahi hai, kaise contribute karenge?
Fork the repository, make changes in your fork, and create a pull request to propose changes to the original repository.

26. Ek commit history ko squash karna hai—kaise karenge?
1. Use `git rebase -i HEAD~n` (where n is the number of commits to squash).
2. Mark commits to squash with `s` (squash) in the interactive rebase editor.
3. Save and exit the editor.
4. Resolve any conflicts if they arise.
